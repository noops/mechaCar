The variables that provided a non random amount of statistical significance to miles per gallon were ground clearance and vehicle length. There is a 0.61 r value correlating mpg and vehicle length. There is also a 0.32 r value correlating mpg and ground clearance.  Interestingly vehicle weight only had an r value of 0.091. I thought this would play a larger factor in affecting miles per gallon. The slope of the model is not considered to be zero. We assume a significance level of 0.05, and our p-value from the linear model is 3.637e-12. This is more than enough to reject the null hypothesis and assume that the slope of the model is not zero. The created linear model effectively predicts miles per gallon approximately 66% of the time. 

After grouping and testing the suspension data we can see that lots 1 and 2 fall within the design specifications for the MechaCar which state that  the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch. Lot 3 exceeds the manufacturer specified variance. The mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for each lot can be seen in the suspension summary. 

After performing a one variable t-test on the suspension data we get a p-value of 0.51. This is higher than our assumed significance level of 0.05. We do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The two means are statistically similar according to the one variable t-test. 

Cars are now available to consumers with more and more technological features. I would propose to run a test to see if some of these technological features improve overall driving experience. The null hypothesis for this test would be that there is not a significant improvement in overall driving experience with more technological features inside of the car. The alternate hypothesis would state that there is a significant difference in driving experience in cars with more technological features. A multiple linear regression model would be ideal for this test.
