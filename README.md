## Overview

This project uses R in combination with Rstudio to perform various statistical analysis on car data. A shapiro-wilks test is performed to check for normality. A multiple linear regression model is used to test for statistical significance between various variables and miles per gallon. A matrix is created to test for correlation to find which variables provide a non random amount of significance to what we are trying to test. R certainly has more statistical analysis tools built in versus a language like python. It seems like a powerful tool to be used in conjunction with other programming languages. Right off the bat I thought that ggplot2 was more intuitive than matplotlib. It seemed easier to format graphs which is a big part of data analysis.
